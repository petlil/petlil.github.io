                    <p>Peter studied composition and sound art at the New Zealand School of Music, though his musical taste and skill has never fit neatly into one box. He makes electroacoustic ambient music and sings in choirs and operas. He studied classical saxophone, and now plays mostly his own bizarre, sometimes meditative (often roaring) soundscape compositions on an old bass saxophone. He also composes for film and makes audio plugins and apps in his spare time.</p>

                    <p><i>“I’m fascinated by generative artistic processes. I make the rules, randomly generate starting conditions, and let the computer make the art. I wonder who is the artist in this scenario? I’m hopeless with a paintbrush, so my visual artwork uses code to achieve granular, repeating or gestural visual patterns, yet these often end up looking pleasing, organic and intentional. I find something so delightful in embracing our very human tendency to discern intention in all phenomena, even when there is none.”</i></p>
